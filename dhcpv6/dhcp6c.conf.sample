# The following is an example for use with IPv6 auto-configuration.
# The "information-only" statement makes dhcp6c exchange informational
# configuration parameters with servers. A list of DNS server addresses
# is an example of such parameters. This statement is useful when the
# client does not need stateful configuration parameters such as IPv6
# addresses or prefixes.

interface ne0 {
	information-only;
};

# The following is a sample configuration for a client on a LAN
# where IPv6 addresses are assigned via DHCPv6 ("stateful address
# assignment"). Use this if you want the client to query the
# DHCPv6 server for an IPv6 address and for DNS servers, as in
# traditional IPv4 DHCP.

interface em0 {
	send ia-na 0;
	send rapid-commit;
	send domain-name-servers;
};

id-assoc na {
};

# The following is an example configuration for delegation of an IPv6 prefix
# from an upstream service provider.  With this configuration dhcp6c will
# send solicit messages containing an IA_PD option, with an IAID 0, on to
# an upstream PPP link, ppp0.  After receiving some prefixes from a server,
# dhcp6c will then configure derived IPv6 prefixes with the SLA ID 1 on a
# local ethernet interface, ne0.  Note that the IAID for the id-assoc
# statement is 0 according to the default.

interface ppp0 {
        send ia-pd 0;
};

id-assoc pd {
        prefix-interface ne0 {
                sla-id 1;
        };
};

# If a shared secret was to be configured in both the client and the server
# for DHCPv6 authentication, it would be specified in this file as follows:

keyinfo kame-key {
     realm "kame.net";
     keyid 1;
     secret "5pvW2g48OHPvkYMJSw0vZA==";
};

# And the interface statement would be modified as follows:

interface ppp0 {
     send ia-pd 0;
     send authentication kame;
};
